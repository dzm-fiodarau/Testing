# SOEN341-Project

## Objective
Develop an Amazon-like web application.

## Description
This web application is an online store where any kind of product can be found and ordered.

### Core Features
* A user should be able to signup and login into an account. Two different types of account exist and some additional functionalities are available to the admin accounts. These functionalities are: adding products to the website, editing the products and deleting them. To any type of user looking through the products should be possible as well as browsing products by category or searching them. Product details should be available to the users as well.
* When going through the products, a user should be able to add whichever product he wants to the shopping cart along with precising the quantity that he wants. In the shopping cart, the user should be able to change the quantity of the products and remove products from the shopping cart.
* The checkout feature should be available on the web application through the shopping cart as well. A user should be able to add a payment method (debit/credit card). In addition, a subtotal should be calculated with taxes and shipping fees and shown to the user whenever the checkout process is initiated. When the payment is processed, an order should be placed in the system of the web application and a confirmation email should be sent to the user. A user that has ordered something should be able to see his past and present orders. If one of his orders has not arrived yet, he should have the possibility to cancel it.
